# MassEffectQuiz
Home Page for the updated Mass Effect Personality Quiz

This is the new Mass Effect quiz format, which was revamped using the base code written by Paige Starkey for a Geocities quiz.

In this stage, the quiz features questions that will help any fans of the Mass Effect franchise figure out which of the six classes they most resemble - Soldier, Engineer, Adept, Infiltrator, Vanguard, or Sentinel. There are 16 questions, and the chances of getting any of the six are equally balanced.

The next stage of my project will be building another page on which to complete the quiz focusing on races in the Mass Effect universe - human, turian, asari, salarian, krogan, quarian, volus, geth, and rachni. Hanar, drell, and elcor may be added at a later date, but it would require a lot of question rebalancing, and there are already a lot of questions for that quiz - several times more than the class one.
